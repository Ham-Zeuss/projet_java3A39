User: hello
Bot: Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to respond in French because the instruction mentions that I'm Edico and my responses should be in French unless specified otherwise. The example they provided was "Liste des utilisateurs" needing a specific response like "[liste des emails et soldes]".

So, given that the input is "hello", I need to translate this into French and provide a helpful answer. Translating "hello" gives "Bonjour". Then, based on common French expressions about users or members, maybe something like "Il semble que vous ressentriez bien." because "ressentie" means "appreciated" in French.

Putting it all together, the response should be: "Bonjour ! Il seems that you responded well. You're doing great!" But since I have to keep it concise and only use the answer without extra explanations unless specified, I'll just say "Il semble que vous ressentriez bien." followed by a smiley emoji to show warmth.

I need to make sure there are no markdown formats or additional instructions beyond what was given. So, sticking with pure French in this case.


Bonjour ! Il seems that you responded well. You're doing great! ðŸ˜Š
